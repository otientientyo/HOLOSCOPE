                            <p>There is a great deal to be learned through the other side of the story these days, Aries. 2020 brought out your more practical and protective side. You were forced to dive so deeply inward, and now you know what you are able to take, and what you can no longer tolerate in your life.</p>
                            <p>As you pummel into 2021 with your naturally inquisitive nature, there can be an honest review of where you want to direct the show. This means that you must take authority back in some capacity throughout the year.</p>
                            <p>Saturn's influence in Aquarius sextiles your sign nicely, giving you a boost of confidence in your career pursuits. This energy can even help you heal some issues around respect and open your mind to new and different methods of leadership. This holds true for you even when a square formed between Saturn in the Water-bearing sign and Uranus in your neighboring sign of Taurus on February 17, June 14, and December 24. There's a direct emphasis on your self-worth during these months as you become more aware of what is best for the greater good.</p>
                            <p>You might feel torn at times if you are striving hard and finding strength by following your own direction. If you keep your eye on the prize, you will not leave anyone behind. In fact, you are carving a lesser-known path to lead the way for an entire community. This year, certain lunar eclipses vacillate between Sagittarius and Gemini, activating your personal zones of higher learning and spiritual development, and requiring you to find the words for what you are feeling.</p>
                            <p>In 2021, you might have many moments of precognition or feel more in alignment with your intuition, especially surrounding the Sagittarian eclipses, being a May 26 total lunar eclipse and a total solar eclipse on December 4.</p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Apr 20 - May 20</div>
                            <p>Welcome to a brand-new year ahead of you, Taurus! There's a ton of unpacking you have yet to do, and yet you do not even know where to fully begin. You've been experiencing the lessons of having the planet of chaos charging through your sign with both glimpses in 2018 and moving full-on in 2019. However, this year adds a bit of strife to this energy.</p>
                            <p>Uranus does not like constraints under any circumstances, and as Saturn opens the year strongly situated in fellow fixed sign Aquarius, you could find yourself in a continual crossroads. In fact, this is the overall energy of your year. Feeling like you are moving forward and being yanked into place having to wait for changes to take their full effect. You might see through things so much that at times, it might even anger you. This year requires a great deal of maturity and patience on your part. Yes, there can feel like great losses, mainly not through your own undoing, but through the continual clash between Saturn in the Water-bearing Aquarius and outer-body Uranus in your sign.</p>
                            <p>The year's lunar cycles are eye-opening in your personal zones of self-acceptance and spiritual growth. The May 26 total lunar eclipse in Sagittarius does shed light on those areas of your life that you've tried to sweep under the rug. Understand that eclipses are galvanizing energy that truly wants you to get real with yourself so that you may heal from this situation. The annual solar eclipse in Gemini on June 10 can add some clarity to your overall financial destiny—also reflected with a partial lunar eclipse in your sign of the Bull on November 19. Then luckily, you'll feel the weight off your shoulders on December 4 as the total solar eclipse sees you revisiting certain events and scenarios around your karmic connections, this time with a renewed sense of self.</p>

                            <p>There’s for sure plenty to talk about this year, Gemini! 2021 is a highly stimulating year for your creative sign. You are able to feel more aligned with your highest good, and can even make some pretty fantastic new friends along the way. You might actually be the go-to person when things get a little rocky, mainly because you adjust so easily and quickly to things and are able to see the humor in almost any situation.</p>
                            <p>As the year begins with some confrontational squares between Jupiter in Aquarius and Uranus in Taurus, you'll get a beneficial wave of abundance headed your way even through some gritty energy. This is also true in mid-February, May, and late December for you as Saturn's transit through Aquarius squares Uranus in Taurus, causing some chaotic waves in the world.</p>
                            <p>This can be tough on others through much of the year; but because Saturn will be nicely angled towards your airy sign, it will be bringing you many insights and brilliant moments. This can be that time where you find yourself in a very powerful way. Expect the unexpected and be extremely grateful for the gifts you receive, because you deserve them!</p>
                            <p>One important piece of the 2021 puzzle is to really consider the transition period of your birthday months. You might be a little caught up during this year's Mercury retrograde cycles, which all take place in air signs. One of the most important for you occurs on May 29, following a transformative total lunar eclipse in your opposing sign of Sagittarius. This is a vibe that will definitely have you rethinking a lot of different pieces of the story. And although it can be a highly enlightening time when it comes to all aspects of your life, there is still much work to be done through the summer. Especially because you are also met with an annular solar eclipse on June 10—at the same time Mercury continues a tricky retrograde cycle in your sign until June 22.</p>

                           <p>You are here for a major reason, and 2021 is one of those years where you've got to surrender to the outcome. You made some incredible changes during 2020 and are making some real headway. There were many ups and downs that could have felt a little more traumatic than normal, especially for your compassionate sign of the Crab.</p>
                            <p>This year really serves as looking at your life from an outsider's perspective. You're able to take an observer’s perspective and might even consider diving into some deep self-reflection that you once shied away from. Working in several facets of spirituality, body care, research, and expanding your mind, in general, is what 2021 is all about. There is nothing too out-of-the-ordinary for you right now, as you might even be more interested in either paranormal or occult-type studies.</p>
                            <p>You are extremely tied to the cycles of the moon, who's nodes now cycle between Gemini in the north position and Sagittarius in the south position. You are working out karmic cycles through learning your own patterns in communication and understanding what stories you've been told for far too long. You might even be faced with the truth about a family situation that you once spent far too much time trying to resolve. Maybe you've sacrificed your own happiness for the good of your loved ones only to come to terms with what you really want for yourself.</p>
                            <p>This is a year where you can really step into your own independence and gain a little emotional space from the judgments of others. There's a refreshing tone to your life once you accept the truth about something you've been stuffing under the rug. 2021, in general, is a time for you to face the music, and see how special you really are! Stop being so hard on yourself, loving Cancer!</p>
